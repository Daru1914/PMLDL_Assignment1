Do members of the committee know... what's going on?
Get it in here!
You'd like to talk with Tom?
Doesn't he have the courage to tell me I'm in trouble?
You can't do that - why not?

You seem to have something on the ribs, that jacket's getting weird.
I'll hold on to it.
Do you have a little boy who's tight?
And I treated it as a bad thing.

I gave it.
Give me my gut, guys.
We have to take it.
My reputation goes down.
If you're trying to get past, I'll take you to the surface.
